# Accessibility Project

## In this project, I was required to refactor an existing piece of code for a marketing agency site. The code has been refactored to improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. Some of the changes that I've made includes adding semantic HTML elements for thorough context of what is on the page and consolidating CSS selectors to increase efficiency.
